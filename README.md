## Synopsis

Coffee Spider is a pure Java web server. It can be used to host a website but it's true power comes in when hosting a web application.

## Motivation

Web frameworks are difficult to learn and implement. Coffee Spider is a MVC Framework, thus everything is where you'd expect to find it. Unlike other web frameworks, Coffee Spider allows you to change the inner workings of the web server. This allows you to create automated tasks using Java instead of creating external scripts and scheduling it with a system scheduler. 

## Installation

This is the source code of an Eclipse project. As such, the project can be downloaded and imported straight into eclipse.
